The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.

This will help you understand the technical constraints and possibilities of your product. It will also help you communicate better with your engineering team.

The best way to learn product management is by doing it. You need to start building products, testing them, and learning from your mistakes.

                                        Product management is a broad field. There are so many things to learn and so many skills to master. It’s impossible to be good at everything. That’s why I think product managers should specialize. They should focus on a specific area of product management and become an expert in that area.

The goal of an MVP is to test fundamental business hypotheses and to help entrepreneurs begin the learning process as quickly as possible.

                                        Marketing is the heart of the product. It’s what makes people want to buy your product. It’s what makes people want to use your product. It’s what makes people want to tell their friends about your product. In this post, I will be sharing my thoughts on why marketing is the heart of the product.
